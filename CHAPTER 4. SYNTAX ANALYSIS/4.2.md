### 4.2.4
***
There is an extended grammar notation in common use. In this notation, square and curly braces in production bodies are metasymbols (like -> or |) with the following meanings:

*i*) Square braces around a grammar symbol or symbols denotes that these constructs are optional. Thus, production ```A -> X [Y] Z``` has the same effect as the two productions ```A -> X Y Z``` and ```A -> X Z```.

*ii*) Curly braces around a grammar symbol or symbols says that these symbols may be repeated any number of times, including zero times. Thus, ```A -> X```, ```A -> X Y Z```, ```A -> X Y Z Y Z```, and so on.

Show that these two extensions do not add power to grammars; that is, any language that can be generated by a grammar with these extensions can be generated without the extensions.

### `Answer`
*i*) ```A -> X [Y] Z``` can be written as ```A -> X Y Z | X Z```

*ii*) ```A -> X {Y Z}``` can be written as
```
A -> X B
B -> Y Z B | ε
```

### 4.2.5
***
Use the braces described in Exercise 4.2.4 to simplify the following grammar for statement blocks and conditional statements:
```
    stmt -> if expr then stmt else stmt
          | if expr then stmt
          | begin stmtList end
stmtList -> stmt ; stmtList | stmt
```

### `Answer`
```
    stmt -> if expr then stmt [else stmt]
          | begin stmtList end
stmtList -> stmt [; stmtList]
```
